# 🛡️ PhishGuard: A URL-Based Machine Learning Approach for Phishing Detection

PhishGuard is a **Machine Learning-based project** that detects phishing websites using only their **URL features**.  
The model analyzes various patterns in URLs (like length, special symbols, and domain structure) and predicts whether a website is **Legitimate** or **Phishing**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Extracts important **URL-based features** automatically.
- Trains and compares multiple **ML algorithms** (Random Forest, SVM, CatBoost, and Stacked Ensemble).
- Achieves **95%+ accuracy** on phishing URL datasets.
- Includes **Flask-based app** for real-time phishing prediction.
- Provides detailed **evaluation metrics and reports**.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- CatBoost  
- Stacked Ensemble (final model with highest accuracy)
